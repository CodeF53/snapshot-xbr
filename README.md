# Snapshot XBR
Automatically generated resource packs for Minecraft using the [xBRZ](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xbrz/) scaling algorithm. 

Designed to be used alongside [VanillaXBR](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/vanillaxbr), as an underlay to provide new textures before Misterk7_- gets to them

## This will be a script that
1. checks for new snapshots
2. download new snapshot if there is one
3. scales its textures using xBRZ 
4. optimizes resulting texures using oxipng
5. uploads the resulting pack to modrinth
